# Heart-attack-analysis-and-prediction-using-ML
Domain knowledge:
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world over the past years.
Several different symptoms are associated with heart disease, which make it difficult to diagnosing it quicker and better.
This is solve can be resolved by adopting machine learning techniques. 

Import libraries and algorithm:
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
From Sklearn
Kneighborclassifiers
StandardScaler

Advantages: 
Early prediction of heart disease can be done
The cost of modification will be minimized.
Accuracy rate will be high.
High performance
